# Leetcode Solutions - Personal Collection

This repository is a collection of my **Leetcode solutions**. It is a personal space where I will store the most interesting and useful solutions I come across while solving problems.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Keep track of the solutions I have solved.
- Store **optimized** and **clever solutions** to problems that I find interesting.
- **Update existing solutions** whenever I come up with a better or more efficient approach.

I will be working on various problems, and I plan to:
- Continuously improve my solutions by **refining** them as I learn new techniques or find better approaches.
- Keep track of the problems I solve, organized by categories, so I can easily refer to them later.

## Why This Repository?

- **Organize my work:** Having all my solutions in one place will help me quickly refer back to them for learning or for preparing for coding interviews.
- **Track my progress:** As I revisit problems and improve my solutions, I’ll see how much I've learned.
- **Keep improving:** I’ll keep trying to find **smarter solutions** and update old ones accordingly.

## Structure

- Solutions are organized by **problem number**.
- I’ll continue to update existing solutions if I discover better approaches.

## Reminder for Myself

- **Don't forget** to update solutions if a better approach comes to mind later.
- **Organize** problems in clear categories for easier reference.
- Keep improving and make sure to solve **interesting and challenging problems**.
